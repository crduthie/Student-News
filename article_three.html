							<p class="title">University research project is Innovation of the Year</p>

							<div class="name">Connor Duthie</div>

							<p class="description">Collaboration with HAS Technology has produced wearable technology which predicts the risk of falls</p>

							<p class="information">A collaboration between Edinburgh Napier and HAS Technology has picked up Innovation of the Year at the fifth Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards.<br><br>

							The awards recognise research and development and innovation-led partnerships which have had a positive impact on the economy, society or the environment through knowledge sharing between businesses, colleges, universities and research institutes.<br><br>

							The University worked with HAS Technology, based in Greenock, to develop wearable technology to predict the risk of people falling.<br><br>

							Advanced Risk Modelling for Early Detection (ARMED) combines pioneering predictive analytics modelling and innovative wearable technology with health and social care data, identifying risks earlier in the care cycle, reducing the number of falls and associated hospital admissions leading to significant financial savings.<br><br>

							With a proven success rate, ARMED has quickly expanded, creating new jobs and demonstrating how artificial intelligence can revolutionise preventative care.<br><br>

							The School of Computing’s Adrian Smales (second from right) led the technical and academic developments, with a focus on areas such as falls detection and frailty. Adrian picked up the award, his second for this collaboration in a week, after collecting the Independent Living award at the Digital Health and Care Awards.<br><br>

							The winners were chosen by a specially selected panel of judges who were looking for academic-business collaborative projects that demonstrated innovation and transformation, as well as individuals who go above and beyond in their contribution to knowledge exchange.<br><br>

							Ivan McKee, Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, presented the awards - organised by Interface, which matches business to Scotland’s world-leading academics to develop and research new products, services and processes - at an event attended by more than 150 people from across Scotland.<br><br>

							Applications were sought from all Scottish universities, research institutes and colleges, as well as businesses and organisations.<br><br>

							Dr Siobhán Jordan, Director of Interface, said: “I always really enjoy the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards which are now in their fifth year.<br><br>

							“Not only do we celebrate the achievements of the businesses we’ve helped match with academic expertise, this unique ceremony showcases the immense talent and expertise in colleges and universities working with industry, which enable sustainable and inclusive economic growth and job creation.”<br><br>

							“The pioneering individuals and R&D partnerships recognised at the Awards have brought huge benefits and impacts which ripple locally, regionally and globally to truly drive industry-led innovation.”<br><br>

							Ivan McKee said: “I’d like to congratulate all the nominees and winners.<br><br>

							“Not only do these awards celebrate activities and projects happening all over Scotland, they bring people together and create new collaborations and partnerships.”<br><br></p>
